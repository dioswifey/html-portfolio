<h1> The Best Movies according to Sohyun Kim </h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr />

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p> One of the favorite anime movies out. Plot, characters, and messages were phenomenal.</p>

<h3>Parasite</h3>
<p> They didn't filter out anything when it comes to criticizing the real world problems in social settings. If you love thrillers, give it a try.</p>

<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>"Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're going to get." -Forrest Gump.</p>
